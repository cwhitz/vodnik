{
  "Normal": "Use restrained, natural prose. Do not rely on flowery language, lyrical excess, or metaphor as a primary device. Prefer simple, well-shaped sentences, precise verbs, and concrete detail. Trust scenes, behavior, and dialogue to carry emotion rather than decorative language. The writing should feel grounded, contemporary, and human.",
  "Fantasy": "Write with wit, clarity, and light-footed humor. Let comedy arise from character, timing, and practical absurdity rather than ornate language or epic posturing. Keep the prose lean and conversational; avoid florid description, extended metaphors, and mock-heroic excess. Favor precise observation, dry understatement, and clean sentence rhythm. The tone should feel clever, humane, and quietly mischievous.",
  "Spicy": "Write explicit, immersive erotica with a focus on physical sensation, emotional immediacy, and moment-to-moment experience. Use concrete, sensory detail and precise verbs; avoid euphemism, coy vagueness, and flowery metaphor. Keep the language grounded in bodies, reactions, and desire rather than poetic abstraction. The prose should feel intimate, confident, and unembarrassed—hot, detailed, and human, without melodrama or ornamental excess."
